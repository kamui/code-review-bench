# Deterministic processing in Rust

This records the processing stage, [#154](https://github.com/kamui/code-review-bench/issues/154), part of
[#149](https://github.com/kamui/code-review-bench/issues/149). It lands in slices that follow the
[delivery plan](https://github.com/kamui/code-review-bench/issues/154#issuecomment-6253814508). Slice 1,
[#193](https://github.com/kamui/code-review-bench/issues/193), adds the crate and ports `roster` and `diff_identity`.

## The `bench-tools` crate

[`rust/bench-tools`](../../rust/bench-tools) builds one binary, `bench-tools`, with one subcommand per tool and one
library module per tool in `src/`. Later slices add their tools to it. Its lints, toolchain and release profile are
those of `rust/usage-pilot`, which stays as pilot evidence. It has no registry dependencies, so an install needs no
network. Shared modules carry the Python behavior that byte-pinned outputs depend on:

- `pyjson` reads JSON as `json.loads` does and writes it as `json.dumps` does, including `float.__repr__` spelling,
  integers of any length up to Python's 4300-digit limit, key order, and `JSONDecodeError` messages.
- `pytext` holds `surrogateescape` decoding, `str.strip` whitespace, `repr`, `pathlib` path joining, universal
  newlines, and the `OSError` and `UnicodeDecodeError` messages that diagnostics quote.
- `sha256` implements SHA-256.

Run a subcommand through the pinned executable, as [Rust runtime pinning](runtime.md#running-a-maintained-command)
describes:

```sh
python3 bench/tools/rust_runtime.py install --crate rust/bench-tools --select
bun run roster
```

## Migrated responsibilities

| Python | Rust | Callers moved | Python implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bench/tools/roster.py` | `bench-tools roster` | `bun run roster` in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` and `bench/README.md` | Deleted with `test_roster.py`, whose cases are in [`roster.v1.json`](../../tools/behavior_contracts/roster.v1.json). |

## Behavior the corpora do not pin

These differences from the Python implementations are outside every contract. A caller that relied on one needs a
recorded decision.

- `bench-tools roster` reads the repository at the current directory unless `--root` names another. `roster.py`
  read the repository that held the script. `bun run roster` runs from the repository root.
- An input whose shape made Python raise a traceback, such as a registry without `suites`, exits 2 with a message
  naming the file. Python exited 1.
- A lone surrogate escape such as `"\ud800"` and JSON nested more than 1,000 levels deep are refused, exiting 2.
  Python kept the surrogate, and its own nesting limit depends on its version and stack.
- `repr` in a diagnostic escapes the non-printable characters Python escapes, except unassigned code points outside
  the noncharacters, because the crate carries no Unicode tables.
- Usage errors print `bench-tools` usage text. Argparse wording is not a contract.

Diagnostics keep the Python program name `roster.py:`, so the differential against it compared them byte for
byte. Renaming them needs a new decision version.

## Research records

`docs/research/last-push-recut-2026-10-07/plan.py` imports `roster`. It is a saved research record whose derived
`review-plan.v1.json` is already committed, and no test loads it. It stays byte-unchanged. Replay it at a commit that
has `bench/tools/roster.py`, such as the source commit its inventory entry resolves to.

## Verification

```sh
cd rust/bench-tools && cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --locked
python3 bench/tools/rust_runtime.py install --crate rust/bench-tools --select
python3 bench/tools/rust_runtime.py resolve bench-tools
python3 tools/behavior_contract.py --corpus tools/behavior_contracts/roster.v1.json
python3 tools/behavior_contract.py --verify-decision-history
```

The `roster` corpus runs the Rust executable by default.
