/**
 * How a control whose visible part is not an `<input>` takes part in a form.
 *
 * Base UI's `Form` validates, focuses and collects only the controls registered
 * with a `Field`, and the one public way to register is `Field.Control`, which
 * is an `<input>` holding a string. A picker's trigger is a button and a file
 * picker's is a drop zone, so on their own they were invisible to a `PlForm`:
 * missing from its values, never blocking a submit, and never showing the error
 * it had for their `name`.
 *
 * `FormControl` is that input, kept off screen. It holds the value as a string,
 * so `required` is the browser's own check, and it hands the focus a form moves
 * to it on to the control a reader actually uses. What a string cannot carry —
 * the two ends of a range, several selections, a list of files — is reported to
 * the `PlForm` around it through `useFormReport`, and `PlForm` lays those over
 * the values Base UI collected.
